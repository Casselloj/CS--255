# CS-255 Reflection

The DriverPass project was about creating a system to help people prepare for and pass their driver's tests. The client wanted a platform that could handle things like managing customer accounts, scheduling drivining appointments, tracking training progress, and providing access to study materials and quizzes. My job was to take those needs and design a system that was not only functional but also easy for users to navigate and use effectively. 

One thing I feel I did well was breaking down the client's requirements into clear, actionable system features. Organizing everything in a way that made sense both for the client and for development was a major focus for me. If I could go back and revise anything, it would be my use case diagram. While I think I did well on my use case diagram, I could have organized it in an easier way to read, and add colors to differentiate each linem making it more clear.  

When it came to understanding and implementing the user's needs, I focused on their priorities, like scheduling and progress tracking, and made sure those features were front and center. Desigining with the user in mind is important because if the system does not work for them, then the system is not correct. 

My general approach to desiging software is to start with a deep dive into the requirements and then map out how everything fits together using tools like UML diagrams and flowcharts. For this project, those techniques worked well, but in the future, I would like to try adding prototypes earler in the process. Those tools could help bring the design to life and make it easier to spot potential issues early on.
